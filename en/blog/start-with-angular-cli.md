## What is Angular CLI?

Angular CLI allows to create the structure if Angular application, generate services, components, modules, routes, and more, easily and fast.

## Install

What we need to start? Have nodejs installed and npm updated. To install nodejs we can go to [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

When node.js has been already installed, we need to update our npm:

```javascript
npm install -g npm // npm update
node --version // verify node version
npm --version // verify npm version
```

Verify that node and npm was updated.

Install Angular CLI is very easy, on the terminal put the next code and press Enter.

```javascript
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

To verify that the was installed successfully, run the command:

```javascript
ng --version
```
